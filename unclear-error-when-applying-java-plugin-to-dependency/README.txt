This is a sample project demonstrating that Gradle displays a confusing error message when the java plugin is applied to a dependency project:

  FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

  * What went wrong:
  Could not determine the dependencies of task ':jefflib2:dokka'.
  > Could not resolve all files for configuration ':jefflib2:debugCompileClasspath'.
     > Failed to transform file 'jefflib1.jar' to match attributes {artifactType=android-classes} using transform JarTransform
        > Transform output file /usr/local/google/workspace/dokka-tests/temp/jefflib1/build/libs/jefflib1.jar does not exist.

Note that when the java plugin is applied to the same project as the dokka-android plugin, then a slightly clearer message (generated by the "com.android.library" plugin) is shown, saying "> The 'java' plugin has been applied, but it is not compatible with the Android plugins."

I'm not sure whether this compatibility should be checked within the dokka-android plugin or within the com.android.library plugin or whether it's something that the dokka-android plugin can in fact support.

Also note that although `find -name build | xargs rm -rf && ./gradlew dokka` fails, `find -name build | xargs rm -rf && ./gradlew build && ./gradlew dokka` succeeds
